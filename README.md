# rutgers-stu22
This was a project in class that I just wanted to do git init and follow the instructions on here

I did a git clone and i was able to get the readme file into my local folder that i was cd'd into in the terminal.

but i couldn't do git status.  i had to do git init.


not sure why this is becuase i would think that git clone would take that need to do git init away


then i noticed that it started with master instead of main but dondrey told us about that

i think this was formed when i did git init

i tried git pull origin main and it didn't work



nevermind, i figured it out.   i had cloned it into my local folder but it started a directory called rutgers-stu22 and i didnt realize it.
i saw the readme and assumed it was this readme from this github repo because i never create readmes on my computer but it was actually the rutgers readme i was looking at
