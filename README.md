This was a project in class that I just wanted to do git init and follow the instructions on here

I did a git clone and i was able to get the readme file into my local folder that i was cd'd into in the terminal.

but i couldn't do git status.  i had to do git init.


not sure why this is becuase i would think that git clone would take that need to do git init away
